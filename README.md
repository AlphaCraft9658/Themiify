# Themiify
A new WIP theme manager for the Wii U console

(This theme manager will be started soon and is in very early stages, so it will not work for a while at all)

## Idea
This theme manager will be available as a .wuhb file and utilize SDCafiine for applying themes. There is a planned patch to add a feature to SDCafiine to better auto-load modpacks or themes in this case.

## Clone the repository
In order to clone the repository for compiling or contributing you will need to run the following command:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AlphaCraft9658/Themiify
```

### TODO
Building container and building instructions
